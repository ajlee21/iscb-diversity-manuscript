### Curated Honorees and Literature-derived Potential Honorees

We curated a dataset of ISCB honorees that included 411 honorees who were keynote speakers at international ISCB-associated conferences (ISMB, RECOMB, and PSB) as well as ISCB Fellows.
The ISCB Fellows set contained the complete set of Fellows named (2009-2019).
Keynote speakers were available for ISMB for all years from 2002-2019.
Keynote speakers from PSB were available for all years from 1999-2020.
Keynote speakers for RECOMB were available for all years from 1997-2019.
We included individuals who were honored multiple times as separate entries.
For example, Christine Orengo was a keynote speaker at RECOMB 2004 and became an ISCB Fellow in 2016, and thus was counted twice in this list.

We sought to compare this dataset with a background distribution of potential speakers, which we considered to be last or senior authors of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We used those published in [Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics), [BMC Bioinformatics](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/), and [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/) as a set of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We downloaded the metadata of manuscripts published in these journals from PubMed, which provided almost 30,000 articles for evaluation.
However, although PubMed provides author order, it does not provide corresponding author information.
To determine corresponding authors for an article, we used the PMC corresponding author information when it was available (20,696 articles) and the PubMed last author as a fallback when corresponding author information was missing (9,053 articles).

### Assessing Gender Diversity of Authors and Honorees

Although _Bioinformatics_ was established in 1998 and _BMC Bioinformatics_ in 2000, the metadata for these journal papers before 2002 only have initials for first and/or middle author names.
Therefore, without first and middle names, we do not have author gender predictions before this year.

We observed a slow increase of the proportion of predicted female authors, arriving at just over 20% in 2019 (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, left).
We observe very similar trend within each journal, but estimated female proportion has increased the least in _PLOS Computational Biology_ ([supplementary notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/09.visualize-gender.html#sup_fig_s1)).
ISCB Fellows and keynote speakers appear to be more evenly split between men and women compared to the population of authors published in computational biology and bioinformatics journals (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, right); however, it has not yet reached parity.
We observed an increasing trend of honorees who were women in each honor category, especially in the group of ISCB Fellows ([supplementary notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/09.visualize-gender.html#sup_fig_s1)), which markedly increased after 2015.
Through 2019 there were a number of examples of meetings or ISCB Fellow classes with a high probability of recognizing only male honorees and none that appeared to have exclusively female honorees.
However, the 2020 PSB keynotes, though outside of the primary range of our analyses, had nearly all the probability ascribed to female speakers.

### Assessing the Racial and Ethnic Diversity of Authors and Honorees

We predicted the race and ethnicity of authors and honorees using wru, which is based on US census data.
We found that an increasing proportion of authors in computational biology and bioinformatics journals had last names associated with selecting Asian as a race/ethnicity category in the US census (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}A).
This was primarily driven by publications in _Bioinformatics_ and _BMC Bioinformatics_ (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}B, top).
We did not observe a corresponding increase at _PLOS Computational Biology_ (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}B, bottom).
Compared to Pubmed authors, ISCB honorees have a higher proportion of individuals whose last names we associated with selecting white as a race/ethnicity category in the US census (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}C vs. A).
Separating honoree results by honor category did not reveal any clear differences (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}D).

![We find an overrepresentation of white and underrepresentation of Asian honorees as compared to authors. Estimated composition of census-based race/ethnicity prediction over the years of
  (A) all Pubmed computational biology and bioinformatics journal authors,
  (B) authors in each journal,
  (C) all ISCB Fellows and keynote speakers,
  and (D) ISCB honorees in each honor category
  was computed as the average of prediction probabilities of Pubmed articles or ISCB honorees each year.
  For each race/ethnicity category, the mean predicted probability of Pubmed articles is shown as teal LOESS curve, and the mean probability and 95% confidence interval of the ISCB honoree predictions are shown as dark circles and vertical lines (E).

We directly compared honoree and author results from 1997 to 2020 for the predicted proportion of white, Asian, and other categories (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}E).
We found that white honorees have been significantly overrepresented and Asian honorees have been significantly underrepresented in most years.

### Predicting Nationality with LSTM Neural Networks and Wikipedia

We next aimed to predict the nationality of honorees and authors.
We constructed a training dataset with more than 700,000 name-nationality pairs by parsing English-language Wikipedia.
We trained a LSTM neural network on n-grams to predict nationality.
We found similar performance across 1, 2, and 3-grams; however, the classifier required fewer epochs to train with 3-grams so we used this length in the model that we term Wiki2019-LSTM.
Our Wiki2019-LSTM returns, for each given name, a probability of that name originating from each of our 8 regions.
We observed a multiclass ROC/AUC score of 0.954 for the classifier, indicating that the classifier can recapitulate name origin with high sensitivity and specificity.
AUC calculated for each region individually was also high, meaning that our classifier was able to perform well on all regions (Fig. {@fig:wiki2019_lstm}).

![The Wiki2019-LSTM model ranks the true nationality of Wikipedia names highly on testing data.
The area under the ROC curve is above 94% for each category, showing strong performance regardless of nationality.

### Assessing the Nationality Diversity of Authors and Honorees

We applied our Wiki2019-LSTM model to both our computational biology honorees dataset and our dataset of corresponding authors.
We found that the proportion of authors in the Celtic English categories had decreased (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A, left), particularly for papers published in _Bioinformatics_ and _BMC Bioinformatics_ ([supplementary notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/11.visualize-nationality.html#sup_fig_s4)).
Among keynote speakers and fellows we found that the majority of honorees are predicted to be from Celtic English countries ({@fig:region_breakdown}A, right).
Though sample sizes were small, we did observe some differences in the composition of minority groups between meetings.
ISMB keynotes had more probability attributable to Israel, while RECOMB had more attributable to East Asian countries ([supplementary notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/11.visualize-nationality.html#sup_fig_s4)).
When we directly compared honoree composition with PubMed, we observed discrepancies between the two groups, namely a large overrepresentation of CelticEnglish (including American) keynote speakers and a substantial underrepresentation of East Asian keynote speakers ({@fig:region_breakdown}B).
Outside of the primary range of our analyses, the two names of 2020 PSB keynote speakers were predicted to be of Celtic English origin (65% probability) and African origin (99% probability), respectively.


![Compared to the name collection of Pubmed authors, Celtic English honorees are overrepresented while East Asian honorees are underrepresented. Estimated composition of nationality prediction over the years of
  (A) all Pubmed computational biology and bioinformatics journal authors,
  and (B) all ISCB Fellows and keynote speakers
  was computed as the average of prediction probabilities of Pubmed articles or ISCB honorees each year.
  For each region, the mean predicted probability of Pubmed articles is shown as teal LOESS curve, and the mean probability and 95% confidence interval of the ISCB honoree predictions are shown as dark circles and vertical lines (E).
