### Curated Honorees and Literature-derived Potential Honorees

We curated a dataset of ISCB honorees that included 411 honorees who were keynote speakers at international ISCB-associated conferences (ISMB, RECOMB, and PSB) as well as ISCB Fellows.
The ISCB Fellows set contained the complete set of Fellows named (2009-2019).
Keynote speakers were available for ISMB for all years from 2002-2019.
Keynote speakers from PSB were available for all years from 1999-2020.
Keynote speakers for RECOMB were available for all years from 1997-2019.
We included individuals who were honored multiple times as separate entries.
For example, Christine Orengo was a keynote speaker at RECOMB 2004 and became an ISCB Fellow in 2016, and thus was counted twice in this list.

We sought to compare this dataset with a background distribution of potential speakers, which we considered to be last or senior authors of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We used those published in [Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics), [BMC Bioinformatics](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/), and [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/) as a set of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We downloaded the metadata of manuscripts published in these journals from PubMed, which provided more than 30000 articles for evaluation.
However, although PubMed provides author order, it does not provide corresponding author information.

We downloaded article information from PubMed Central (PMC), which provides corresponding author information to directly measure the fraction of manuscripts for which last authors were also corresponding authors in these journals.
Of the 21411 articles in PMC, the last author was also a corresponding author for 17401 of them.
Because the concordance was high and the PubMed set was more complete, we used the PMC corresponding author information when it was available and the PubMed last author as a fallback when corresponding author information was missing.

### Assessing Gender Diversity of Authors and Honorees

Although Bioinformatics was established in 1998 and BMC Bioinformatics in 2000, the metadata for these journal papers before 2002 only have initials for first and/or middle author names.
Therefore, without first and middle names, we do not have author gender predictions before this year.

We observed a slow increase of the proportion of predicted female authors, arriving at just over 20% in 2019 (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}A).
We observe very similar trend within each journal, but estimated female proportion has increased the least in _PLOS Computational Biology_ (Supplementary Fig. S1).
ISCB Fellows and keynote speakers appear to be more evenly split between men and women compared to the population of authors published in computational biology and bioinformatics journals (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}B); however, it has not yet reached parity.
An overall increasing female proportion trend appeared in each honor category, especially in the group of ISCB Fellows (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}C), which markedly increased after 2015.
Through 2019 there were a number of examples of meetings or ISCB Fellow classes with a high probability of recognizing only male honorees and none that appeared to have exclusively female honorees.
However, the 2020 PSB keynotes, though outside of the primary range of our analyses, had nearly all the probability ascribed to female speakers.

### Assessing the Racial and Ethnic Diversity of Authors and Honorees

We predicted the race and ethnicity of authors and honorees using wru, which is based on US census data.
We found that an increasing proportion of authors in computational biology and bioinformatics journals had last names associated with selecting Asian as a race/ethnicity category in the US census (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}A).
This was primarily driven by publications in _Bioinformatics_ and _BMC Bioinformatics_ (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}B, top).
We did not observe a corresponding increase at _PLOS Computational Biology_ (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}B, bottom).
Compared to Pubmed authors, ISCB honorees have a higher proportion of individuals whose last names we associated with selecting white as a race/ethnicity category in the US census (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}C vs. A).
Separating honoree results by honor category did not reveal any clear differences (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}D).

![We find an overrepresentation of white and underrepresentation of Asian honorees as compared to authors. Estimated composition of census-based race/ethnicity prediction over the years of
  (A) all Pubmed computational biology and bioinformatics journal authors,
  (B) authors in each journal,

  and (E) the composition's statistics of Pubmed authors (teal LOESS curve) and ISCB honorees (mean and 95% confidence interval, vertical) for each race/ethnicity category.

We directly compared honoree and author results from 1997 to 2020 for the predicted proportion of white, Asian, and other categories (Fig. {@fig:racial_makeup}E).
We found that white honorees have been significantly overrepresented and Asian honorees have been significantly underrepresented in most years.

### Predicting Nationality with LSTM Neural Networks and Wikipedia

We achieved a high overall accuracy on this test data with similar precision-recall values over the classes as we saw for our Wiki2019 datasetâ€™s test set, giving confidence in our model.
We also tested the accuracy of the LSTM trained on the ethnicolr Wiki2009 dataset in predicting the labels for unseen names in our Wiki2019 dataset.
Importantly, this model did not achieve as high an accuracy as the model trained on Wiki2019 and tested on either dataset, suggesting our new, larger dataset was an improvement.

### Assessing the Nationality Diversity of Authors and Honorees

We applied our Wiki2019-LSTM model to both our computational biology honorees dataset and our dataset of corresponding authors.
We found that the proportion of authors in the CelticEnglish categories had decreased (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A), particularly for papers published in _Bioinformatics_ and _BMC Bioinformatics_ (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}B).
Among keynote speakers and fellows we found that the majority of honorees are predicted to be from CelticEnglish countries ({@fig:region_breakdown}C).
Though sample sizes were small, we did observe some differences between meetings.
ISMB keynotes had more probability attributable to Israel, while RECOMB had more attributable to EastAsian countries ({@fig:region_breakdown}D).
When we directly compared honoree composition with PubMed, we observed discrepancies between the two groups, namely a large overrepresentation of CelticEnglish (including American) keynote speakers and a substantial underrepresentation of East Asian keynote speakers ({@fig:region_breakdown}E).
The proportion of keynote speakers of African, Muslim, and Hispanic origin were also slightly smaller than the field of computational biology as a whole, as represented by corresponding authors in major journals.
