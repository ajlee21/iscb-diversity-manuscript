### Curated Honorees and Literature-derived Potential Honorees

We curated a dataset of ISCB honorees that included 412 honorees who were keynote speakers at international ISCB-associated conferences (ISMB, RECOMB, and PSB) as well as ISCB Fellows.
The ISCB Fellows set contained the complete set of fellows named (2009-2019).
Keynote speakers were available for ISMB for all years from 2002-2019.
Keynote speakers from PSB were available for all years from 1999-2020.
Keynote speakers for RECOMB were available for 16 years between 1997 and 2019.

We sought to compare this dataset with a background distribution of potential speakers, which we considered to be last or senior authors of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We used those published in Bioinformatics, BMC Bioinformatics, and PLOS Computational Biology as a set of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We downloaded metadata from PubMed for manuscripts published in these journals, which provided more than 29000 articles for evaluation.
However, while PubMed provides author order it does not provide corresponding author information.

We downloaded article information from PubMedCentral’s Open Access corpus, which provides corresponding author information to directly measure the fraction of manuscripts for which last authors were also corresponding authors in these journals.
Of the 21411 articles in PMC’s OA set, the last author was also a corresponding author for 17401 of them.
Because the concordance was high and the PubMed set was more complete, we used the PubMed last author set for all subsequent analyses.

### Assessing Gender Diversity of Authors and Honorees

### Assessing the Racial and Ethnic Diversity of Authors and Honorees

We predicted the race and ethnicity of authors and honorees using wru, which is based on US census data.
We found that an increasing proportion of authors in computational biology and bioinformatics journals had last names associated with selecting Asian as a race/ethnicity category in the US census (Fig 2A).
This was primarily driven by publications in Bioinformatics (Fig 2B) and BMC Bioinformatics (Fig 2C).
We did not observe an increasing trend at PLOS Computational Biology (Fig 2D).
We found a higher proportion of individuals who had last names associated with selecting white as a race/ethnicity category in the US census were ISCB honorees (Fig 2E) than authors (Fig 2A).
Separating honoree results by honor category did not reveal any clear differences (Supplementary Figure 2).

We directly compared honoree and author results from 1999 to 2020 for the predicted proportion of white (Fig 2F), Asian (Fig 2G), and other (Fig 2H) categories.
We find that white honorees have been significantly overrepresented and Asian honorees have been significantly underrepresented since the year 2000.
Though we estimate the fraction of non-white and non-Asian authors to be relatively similar to the estimated honoree rate, we note that both are represented at levels substantially lower than in the US population.
The proportion of Hispanic authors and honorees at these venues may also be influenced by authors from Spain instead of Latin America and is likely to understate the extent to which minoritized scientists are underrepresented among honorees and authors.
