### Honoree Curation

#### ISCB Fellows Recipients

We examined the ISCB webpage of ISCB Fellows [@url:https://www.iscb.org/iscb-fellows].
We found recipients listed for the years 2009-2019.
We gleaned the full name of the fellow as well as the year in which they received the honor.
We used the name as provided on the site. For certain methods we were required to split the full name into first and last names.
In this case we chose the first non-initial name as the first name and the final name as the last name.
We did not consider a hyphen to be a name separator, so both side of hyphenated names were included.

#### ISMB Keynote Speakers

We examined the webpage for each ISMB meeting.
We were able to successfully find pages with keynote speakers for the years 2002-2019.
We gleaned the full name of each keynote speaker as well as the year in which they delivered a keynote.
We used the name as provided on the site.
We split names into first and last names as described for ISCB Fellows.

#### PSB Keynote Speakers

We examined the webpage for each PSB meeting.
We were able to successfully find pages with keynote speakers for the years 1999-2020.
We gleaned the full name of each keynote speaker as well as the year in which they delivered a keynote.
We used the name as provided on the site.
We split names into first and last names as described for ISCB Fellows.

#### RECOMB Keynote Speakers

We examined the webpage for each RECOMB meeting.
We were able to successfully find pages with keynote speakers for the years 1997-2019.
We were able to fill in the missing years using information from other sources [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-31957-5; @doi:10.1145/565196; @doi:10.1145/640075; @doi:10.1145/974614; @doi:10.1007/b135594; @doi:10.1007/11732990; @doi:10.1007/978-3-642-02008-7].
We gleaned the full name of each keynote speaker as well as the year in which they delivered a keynote.
We used the name as provided on the site.
We split names into first and last names as described for ISCB Fellows.

### Analysis of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Publications

We developed two distinct approaches to estimate the composition of research advisors in the field, who we expected would be those most likely to be invited for keynotes or to be honored as Fellows.
We downloaded the author information for all papers published in ISCB Partner Journals (PLOS Computational Biology and Bioinformatics) as well as a field-specific journal that is not a partner (BMC Bioinformatics) from PubMed (PM) as well as PubMedCentral (PMC) from when each journal was established to the present.

PM provided a more comprehensive resource.
The PM set contained 12963 manuscripts published in Bioinformatics, 6349 published in PLOS Computational Biology, and 9124 published in BMC Bioinformatics.
Despite being more comprehensive, the PM set of manuscripts did not provide corresponding author information.
We inferred that the leading senior author of a manuscript would be in the last author position.
We selected the last author from each paper as our set for consideration.

PMC provided a more limited resource but contained more detailed corresponding author information.
The PMC set contained 4797 articles published in Bioinformatics, 6296 published in PLOS Computational Biology, and 9099 published in BMC Bioinformatics.
We examined the corresponding author number for each paper and found that all but 359 had at least one corresponding author.
We manually examined a subset of the manuscripts without corresponding authors and found that many were editorials (e.g., the announcement of PLOS Computational Biology).
The vast majority of publications (17064) had only a single corresponding author.
We used the corresponding authors from the PMC set as our set for consideration.

### Estimation of Gender

We predicted the gender of honorees and authors using the genderize.io API [@url:https://genderize.io].
We used author and honoree first names to retrieve predictions from genderize.io.
The predictions, which consider gender as a binary trait, represent the probability of an honoree or author being male or female.

### Estimation of Race and Ethnicity

We predicted the race and ethnicity of honorees and authors using the R package `wru`.
`wru` implements methods described in Imai and Khanna [@doi:10.1093/pan/mpw001] to predict race and ethnicity using surname and location information.
The underlying data used for prediction are derived from the United States Census.
We used only the surname of author or honoree to make predictions via the `predict_race()` function.
We slightly modify the source code to enable the function to return inconclusive results and prevent its automatic imputation of average demographic distribution for names absent from the census.
This prediction represents the probability of an honoree or author selecting a certain race or ethnicity on a census form if they lived within the United States.
