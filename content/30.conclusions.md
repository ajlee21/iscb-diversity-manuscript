## Conclusions

The presence of female STEM role models is associated with higher persistence for undergraduate women in geoscience [@doi:10.1130/GES01659.1].
Efforts are underway to create Wikipedia entries for more female [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05947-8] and black, Asian, and minority scientists [@doi:10.1038/d41586-019-00812-8], which can help early-career scientists identify role models.
Societies, both through their honorees and the individuals who deliver keynotes at their meetings, can play a positive role as well.
We find that ISCB’s honorees and keynote speakers, though not yet reaching gender parity, appear to be more evenly split between men and women than the field as a whole.
On the other hand, we find that honorees include significantly few people of color than the field as a whole, and that Asian scientists are dramatically under-represented among honorees.

The central role that scientists play in evaluating each other and each other’s findings makes diversity particularly critical.
Even many nominally objective methods of assessing excellence (h-index, grant funding obtained, number of high-impact peer-reviewed publications, total number of peer-reviewed publications) are subject to the bias of peers during review.
These could be affected by explicit biases, implicit biases, or pernicious biases in which a reviewer might consider a path of inquiry, as opposed to an individual, to be more or less meritorious based on the reviewer's own background [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aaw7238].
Our efforts to measure the diversity of honorees in an international society suggests that, while a focus on gender parity may be improving some aspects of diversity among honorees, scientists of color do not appear to be recognized at levels consistent with their membership among the pool of potential honorees.
